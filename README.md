# python-doubleratchet
#### A python implementation of the Double Ratchet algorithm.

This python library offers an implementation of the Double Ratchet algorithm as specified [here](https://signal.org/docs/specifications/doubleratchet/).

Goals for this implementation are:
- Keep it small and simple
- Don't assume any parameters, leave it all configurable

This library is currently in a very early state, most of the code has not been tested at all, there are probably bugs.
